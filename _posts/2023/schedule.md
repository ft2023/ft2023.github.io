We aim to enlighten the attendees with state-of-the-art graph learning research, engage the attendees to ignite new ideas and discussions, and finally consolidate the ideas and findings into a synopsis that can benefit and guide the graph learning community as a whole.
The actual workshop schedule will be aligned with the NeurIPS 2023 official schedule. The detailed schedule awaits **to be determined**.
