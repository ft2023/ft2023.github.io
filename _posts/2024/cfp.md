<!-- **Updates:** 
- Please use the following <a href="/files/neurips_glfrontiers_2023.sty" style="font-weight: bold;">NeurIPS GLFrontiers style file</a> for **the camera ready submission**, which has the correct notice at the first page of your paper. Please use the option `\usepackage[final]{neurips_glfrontiers_2023}` in your main text file. Please **upload your camera ready version via making a revision at OpenReview**. -->

**FAQ**
- **AGIworkshop is a non-archival workshop**. If you have concurrent submissions to other venues, please feel free to submit to our workshop as well.
- Suppose your submission will present at the ICLR main conference, we suggest the author **do not** submit to the workshop, as it leads to unnecessary redundancy at the venue. If your submission has been rejected by the ICLR main conference, *we welcome you to submit to our workshop*.
- You may think of the full-length research paper as a standard conference submissions. Meanwhile, we highly welcome the 7-page short submissions as well; for example, if you have worked on exciting ideas but the paper is not fully finished (e.g., missing some baselines or experiments), or the idea itself does not take a full 9 pages to describe (e.g., a new training strategy, loss function, or initialization that works surprisingly well).


The workshop will be held fully in person at the Vienna, Austria, as part of the [ICLR 2024 conference](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024).
We also plan to offer livestream for the event, and more details will come soon. 

This workshop aims to become a melting pot for ideas, discussions, and debates regarding our proximity to AGI. We invite submissions on a range of topics including, but not limited to:
- **Frontiers of AGI research**: examples include AI agents, embodied AI, retrieval-based and tool- augmented LLMs, knowledge-enhanced AI, and multi-agent AI.

- **Classic AGI Attempts as Inspiration**: Delving into historical methods such as expert systems, symbolic AI, Type I and Type II reasoning for insights that can guide LLM research further.

- **Interdisciplinary Insights for AGI**: Drawing parallels from fields like psychology, sociology, and neuroscience to inspire and inform the development of LLMs towards AGI.

- **Fundamental Limitations of LLMs**: Analyzing the intrinsic capabilities or lack thereof in LLMs that might impede their progression to AGI. This includes discussions on reasoning, planning, and more.

- **Practical Limitations of LLMs and Foundation models**: Addressing external challenges like system constraints, computational costs, data acquisition barriers, and privacy concerns.

- **Safety, Ethics, and Regulation in AGI Development**: Exploring the complexity of moral, safety, and regulatory concerns that will shape AGI’s evolution.

- **AGI’s Economic and Societal Impacts**: Probing the potential changes AGI might initiate into our societies, economies, and daily lives.



We welcome both short research papers of up to 7 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials), and full-length research papers of up to 9 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials). 
All accepted papers will be presented as posters. 
We plan to select 10 papers for short oral presentations and 1-2 papers for the outstanding paper award.


All submissions must use the [ICLR template](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2024.zip). We do not require the authors to include the checklist in the template. Submissions should be in `.pdf` format, and the review process is **double-blind**---therefore the papers should be appropriately anonymised. Previously published work (or under-review) is acceptable.
